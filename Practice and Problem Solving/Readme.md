Problem Solving and Stepwise process

1) You are given an array of numbers (non-negative). Find a continuous subarray of the list which adds up to a given sum.
    eg:
        [, 7, {4, 2, 1, 3}, 11, 5]
            { sum = 10 }

2) Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of steps required to convert A to B. (each operation is counted as 1 step.) You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
    -> Insert a character
    -> Delete a character
    -> Replace a character
