Binary Tree:
The left subtree of any node only contains nodes with keys that are lexicographically smaller than the node's key,
and the right subtree of any node only contains nodes with keys that lexicographically larger than the node's key.
A tree that satisfies this property is called a binary search trees,
and it's easy to locate a specific key by traversing a single path down from the root note.
